      <p class="has-text-left">
        When it comes to penalties, the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders are in a league of their own. Since 2011, the team has racked up more penalties than any other franchise, according to an analysis of NFL statistics. Raider fans have long claimed their team has been unfairly targeted by referees, but the data shows that the picture is far more complicated.
     </p>
     <p class="has-text-left">
        For decades the entire Raiders organization — from the owner, the late Al Davis, to its most dedicated fans — built a notorious reputation throughout the NFL. Nasty, mean, and gritty described the Super Bowl champion Raiders of the 1970’s and 1980’s. This era of Raiders football is so infamous that, after decades, they still find themselves at the top of <a href='https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-dirtiest-football-teams-of-all-time', target='_blank'>modern day rankings</a> of “the dirtiest football teams of all time.” Raiders fans have often embraced the organization’s unsavory reputation and internalized it as <a href='https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1228865-oakland-raiders-why-fanbase-is-most-misunderstood-in-sports' target='_blank'>part of their identity</a>, which has led to visiting fans describing the crowd as aggressive, violent, or antagonistic. 
     </p>
     <p class="has-text-left">
        As the NFL began to crackdown on what it deemed to be “dirty”, or unsafe play, new rules emerged to curtail the play style that the Raiders had personified for so long. This transition towards a less viscous and dangerous game threatened the identity of the Raiders on the field and its fans in the stands. Incurring penalties became just as associated with the Raiders as the gridiron football they had become so famous for.

        But does the Raiders’ propensity for incurring penalties hold up in the modern day NFL? At first glance, the answer is a resounding yes. Over the past decade, the Raiders have been the most penalized team 40% of the time, and among the top five penalized teams 60%. They’ve consistently surpassed the NFL average, even in their least penalized seasons.
     </p>
     <p class="has-text-left">
        This seems to lend some credence to the idea that the Raiders may be unfairly targeted by the NFL and its referees, as its most passionate fans claim. When digging into the types of penalties though, the picture becomes murkier.
     </p>
      <figure class="mt-5 mb-5 image is-inline-block chart">
        <iframe title="Raiders among top penalized teams across all categories" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-3ebJt" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3ebJt/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="550"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
      </figure>
      <p class="has-text-left">
        Penalties can be divided into three general categories: those that are flagrant, such as roughing the passer and hitting a player after the end of a play, those that are arbitrary and often unevenly enforced such as offensive holding and defensive pass interference, and those that are procedural and called before the snap such as false start and offsides. Among these three categories, those in which the bias of the referees could reasonably come into play are the arbitrary ones.
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-left">
        While the Raiders are the most penalized within the arbitrary category, they are also among the top three across the other two categories. What this demonstrates is that, regardless of whether the referees have undue influence over the penalty being called, the Raiders are still at fault.
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-left mb-5">
        The pattern that emerges is one of recklessness. The Raiders, while the most penalized within the arbitrary category, are not penalized disproportionately. Given that they commit other types of penalties at nearly an identical rate, it’s hard to argue that it’s all a conspiracy.
