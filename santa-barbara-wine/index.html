      <h3 class="has-text-left is-size-4">A California Wine Empire</h3>
      <p class="has-text-left is-size-4">
        It’s no secret that California is the wine capital of the United States. Wineries out of Napa Valley — Grgich Hills and Stag’s Leap Wine Cellar — famously <a target="_blank" href="https://www.grgich.com/the-paris-tasting/#:~:text=The%20nine%20French%20judges%20blind,or%20white%2C%20in%20the%20tasting">won a 1976 blind taste contest</a> for both red and white wine in Paris, beating out all of their French competitors. The result was unprecedented, and it vaulted California wine to international glory.

        Within the United States, California wine continues to dominate to this day. Whether examining prestige, price, or sheer volume, California stands above the rest. 

        California’s strength is reflected in how much revenue the wine industry contributes to its economy; just over the past 10 years, annual wine sales have increased 33%, eclipsing $40 billion.

      <h3 class="has-text-left is-size-4">A History of Santa Barbara Wine</h3>
      <p class="has-text-left is-size-4">
        Santa Barbara, California, a county located in southern California 100 miles north of Los Angeles, is often thought first and foremost as a beachy getaway. Picturesque views and immaculate weather have historically drawn in multitudes of tourists; an <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara_(TV_series)">internationally famous soap opera</a> with the city’s namesake brought international attention; but its wine has become an ever greater draw. 
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-left is-size-4">
        Santa Barbara has been producing wine for hundreds of years, reaching back to the <a target="_blank" href="https://martellotto.com/blogs/martellotto-wines/history-of-santa-barbara-wine-country-part-1-the-early-years">days of Spanish colonization.</a> While the number of vineyards and acreage grew over time, it wasn’t until the 1970’s and 1980’s that the wine business began to truly flourish with the establishment of the “Santa Barbara County Vintner’s Association” in 1983, founded by 13 of Santa Barbara’s largest wineries. The following three decades saw explosive growth, and by 2010 there were more than <a target="_blank" href="https://martellotto.com/blogs/martellotto-wines/the-history-of-santa-barbara-wine-country-part-3-big-money-big-business">100 wineries in Santa Barbara</a>, covering over 20,000 acres of land.
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-left is-size-4">
        A rapid growth in Santa Barbara’s wine industry has gone hand in hand with a corresponding rise in popularity; as demand for Santa Barbara wine has increased, so has the value of its wine grapes. Since 1980, the price of a single ton of grapes has shot up from roughly $500 to $2000 — a staggering 400%.

      <h3 class="has-text-left is-size-4">The "Funk Zone" and Wine Tourism</h3>
      <p class="has-text-left is-size-4">
        Formerly the industrial, marine, and manufacturing part of town, the “Funk Zone” is an area of Santa Barbara located just off of State Street and the downtown buzz. Largely abandoned in the 1980’s, the area has been renovated tremendously over the past decade, becoming the go-to place for wine tastings. The number of wineries and wine tasting rooms <a target="_blank" href="https://urbanwinetrailsb.com/wineries/funk-zone/">in the Funk Zone</a> has exploded with no end in sight; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.noozhawk.com/article/funk_zone_building_gets_positive_comments_from_santa_barbara_abr_20210224">a new development of unprecedented scale</a> is underway to transform an abandoned warehouse in the heart of the Funk Zone into a bustling wine-tasting business with a roof deck and bar.
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-left is-size-4">
        Wine tourism makes up a staggering <a target="_blank" href="https://martellotto.com/blogs/martellotto-wines/the-history-of-santa-barbara-wine-country-part-3-big-money-big-business">⅔ of Santa Barbara wine country sales</a>, intrinsically linking Santa Barbara’s wine business to the Funk Zone and the plethora of wine tasting rooms throughout the city. An analysis of Yelp data reveals that among the businesses in Santa Barbara associated with the keyword “wine”, over 60% of them are either categorized as a “wine tasting room”, “winery”, or “wine tour”. This number far exceeds that of other California cities, such as San Diego and San Jose, which hover around 15%. It’s comparable instead to the capital of California wine — Napa County — which holds a figure exceeding 80%.

        Santa Barbara’s embracement of wine has paid itself back in dividends; whether it be the rise of wine tourism or the corresponding economic revenue, Santa Barbara has positioned itself to rake in the benefits of an industry that has catapulted an entire state.
